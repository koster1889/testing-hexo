Hi there!

I'm testing this Hexo thing. It's a static site generator and/or blog platform. It looks nice!

---

The default source for the blog posts are Markdown (so I'll have to learn that as well...).

**Fun**, *kinda*.

```
some(simple, looking, code/monospace, {line: numberThings});
```

---

# Getting started

Using `npm` you `install --global`ly the `hexo-cli`.

Then you han use `hexo` to `init` `some-folder`. And go bananas with the markdown files!

This might be useful for github pages :OoOOo
